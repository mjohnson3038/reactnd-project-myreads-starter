# MyReads Project

## About the repo
This is the MyReads project part of the Udacity React Nano Degree course. This project is a bookcase where users can move a book between shelves (read, want to read, and reading) along with searching for books.

## Launch Project

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Sources
In addition to the Udacity learning, I also used -> https://hackernoon.com/how-to-take-advantage-of-local-storage-in-your-react-projects-a895f2b2d3f2 to learn about saving state to local storage and using the react lifecycle events to do the loading/unloading os state.

## If I were to do this again ...
If I were to do this project again, I would only store the book_id in the state and I would use the API to get the book and it's information (title, author, etc.) in the book component with the API. I didn't make very good use of the API in this project but this would improve with the change suggested. I think that I did a fairly good job at breaking down the code into reusable components.
